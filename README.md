# 05.05-Pydata-Capstone-Project
This is the end of Python Data Analysis Module. 

### Introduction 
For your capstone, you have the freedom to choose one of the following data analysis and visualisation projects. If you would like to do a project beyond what has been suggested here, kindly reach out to your TM for approval before starting the project. All these projects will allow you to practice the data cleaning, data analysis, and visualisation skills that you have gone through the entire course:

### Objectives 
Your objectives are to provide insights, by combining data or dicing the data in ways that could not be possible otherwise. 
You also should aim to creat a narrative based on the information/deductions you have from the graphs created. An example of a good narrative is like this [project by our wolrd in data](https://ourworldindata.org/indoor-air-pollution) 
You can go a step further and create interactive graphs and map your data. Even if geographical information has not been provided in your dataset, as we have learnt in class, you can combine with other sources of data and get additional information. 

### Key Metrics : 
Your capstone will be evaluated on the basis of the following
- Code Quality - Includes the flow you have taken in your notebook and conventions as explained in class as well as your ReadMe Summary. 
- Story points - How many deductions have you made and what is the quality of such insights. 
- Narrative with the data and accuracy of the deductions.
